        Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen).
        The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.
        In VS Code you can write or print to console using console.log() command.

        console.log("Hi i am console screen");
        var first_name="Ranbir";
        var last_name="Kapoor";
     
        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
       console.log(full_name);
        var a = 10;
        var b = 5;
         var add= a+b;
         console.log(add);
          
         var pow_eg1= Math.pow(10,2);
       console.log(pow_eg1);
